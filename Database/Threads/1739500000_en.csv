David | Must-Read Books for 2025 | 1739500000 | I'm looking to expand my reading list this year with some thought-provoking books. I'm particularly interested in a mix of fiction and non-fiction, covering topics like personal development, science, and classic literature. If you've read something recently that had a lasting impact, I'd love to hear your recommendations. What books should be on my must-read list for 2025?

Sophia | 1739500800 | One book that really stood out to me was *Atomic Habits* by James Clear. It dives deep into the psychology of habit formation and offers practical advice on making small changes that lead to significant results. It’s an excellent read if you're into self-improvement and want actionable strategies for success.
Ethan | 1739501700 | If you're looking for something immersive in fiction, I highly recommend *The Midnight Library* by Matt Haig. It’s a beautifully written novel that explores the concept of regret and second chances through a unique, almost magical perspective. It’s both thought-provoking and emotional.
Olivia | 1739502600 | For a mix of science and philosophy, check out *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind* by Yuval Noah Harari. It provides a fascinating look at the history of human civilization, the evolution of cultures, and how our societies came to be the way they are today. It’s one of those books that truly changes the way you see the world.
